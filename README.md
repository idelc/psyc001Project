# psyc001Project
This project will educate the user on the biological basis of psychology. As such, it will cover:
  Lobes of the brain
  Survival structures in the brain
  Subcortical structures
  Neurons and their use

The idea behind this game is to introduce the player to the anatomy of the brain and, more importantly, the functions of the different structures. The player will move through the game and find the information in the “environment”. In doing so, it may help the player remember the concepts if they can associate them with a story instead of the concepts by themselves.
