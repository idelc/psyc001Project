# psyc001Project
This project will educate the user on the biological basis of psychology. As such, it will cover:
  Lobes of the brain
  Survival structures in the brain
  Subcortical structures
  Neurons and their use

The player will go through a small text-based adventure where they will discover clues to solve a puzzle at the end of their journey. The clues will take the form of class concepts, and the puzzle at the end will be an assessment of the concepts. In this way, the player not only learns class concepts but can study them through challenged recall, and not just review.
