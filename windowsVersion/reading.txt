You are a treasure hunter, and have discovered rumors of a place deep in the jungles of Brabari, where science and technology advanced rapidly, before the civilization disappeared, leaving all its riches behind. But you are sure they did not leave them unguarded. You set off, ready to get going before anyone else has a chance to catch wind of where you are going.
First, we will get you used to the way this game works. At points along your journey, you will have decisions to make. You will see a number of options, type in the number of the option you want to see. You sit down to plan your trip.
Ready? Lets go!
You pack your bags and get ready for your flight to Brabari, eager to begin your adventure. The plane ride goes smoothly, and it gives you time to think about what you will do once you arrive. You soon find yourself at the airport, and head off to the outskirts of the city, buying some supplies before you go. You take a path through the jungle, following your map and compass when the path becomes overgrown.
You pass by a small village in a clearing. The people there are busy with their daily tasks, caring for children or animals, or making things to sell and trade. You think it cannot hurt to ask them if they know anything about the area. They do not know much, but they did recently find an old pot half buried near the area. It had some paper inside of it, as well as some trinkets. Most of it was decomposed by now, but the innermost piece of paper was still legible. It was a keepsake of the person who found the old pot, but they let you read it. It said:
You copy this down and continue on your journey, heading toward where the person told you they dug up the pot. You find what they told you, a huge stone with a hole in the middle, with some carving of what looks like a branch originating from the hole. There is a flat round stone on the floor, with a hole in the center and a hole near the edge. You look closely, and notice that the small hole in the huge stone goes in deep. You take an equally large stick and push it through. You hear some clicks at the end. What do you do?
The boulders spin a quarter turn to reveal some peculiar entrances to what you think is the compound.
The entrances are unremarkable, except for a strange symbol carved above them. You recognize the symbol from the research you did. It matches the symbol on a scrap of paper you found in the book you were reading that told you about this place. You take out the copy you made, and read it:
You make note of the crude drawing that shows a group of people passing through an archway, and one lone person standing outside of another. You know it is a hint as to how to get past this point, but are not sure what to do with it.
You assume the drawing meant that there needed to be multiple living things entering the compound at once for the entrance to work properly. As you continue, you notice the entrances seem to converge into a single hallway, about two people wide. You take out your flashlight and turn it on while you continue walking further in. It is not long before you arrive at an archway, with what looks like ancient writing. You hear a faint buzzing noise, and turn your light toward the stone walls and floor. There are openings along the wall, evenly spaced as far as you can see. There are pressure plates all over the floor. You begin looking at the writing, and decide to set your light on a tripod to keep the arch lit. You then take out the book you brought with you that tells you what some of the symbols mean. After an hour or so, you come up with the following translation:
You muse over the inscription, thinking about it and what it has to do with the hallway. You put some disposable supplies on one of the plates, and hear some hissing coming from the openings on the wall as a mist is released briefly. What will you do?
The large room you arrive in has a glowing crystal that you are pretty sure is powering the pressure plates in the hallway. You carefully remove the crystal, and it returns to normal as you do so, so you wrap it and put it in your pack carefully.
You wave your light around, taking in the surroundings like someone who has just arrived at a city after having spent their whole life in the country. You take many pictures and notes, amazed at the craftsmanship of the room. You find a metal plate affixed to the wall next to a door of some sort. After some decryption, you deduce it reads:
You study the room some more before focusing on the doorway. There is a thin slab of obsidian in the center, with a small round socket right above it. A label on it reads “prefrontal cortex”. After some inspection, you determine it looks similar to where the crystal was. You take it out and stick the tip in the socket; it is like putting a cap on a pen. Humanoid figures appear in the obsidian, and cycle between poses, with some text that says “Use it”.
The humanoid figures disappear and the door rumbles as it rises and allows you to pass onto the next room. Having put two and two together, you match what the hint said to what the screen displayed, and jot down this before continuing:
From there, you enter the room. It is by far the largest, and has a few scattered platforms and pillars in various stages of disrepair. The only door here is near the top of the wall across from you.
You look around. There are some gnarly looking vines near you, so you decide to steer clear of them just in clase. You realize the room feels well lit, as sunlight was partially coming in, but you do not see any cracks or direct sunlight anywhere. It makes you somewhat uneasy, but you continue having a look around. There are remnants of what seemed like murals on the walls, but they are too far gone to make out what they used to be. Some places have been overgrown by vines along the wall as well. What will you do?
Once there, the vine hands you a small stone tablet with the inscription:
It pats you on the head before returning to its position by the door. You are disturbed, but continue onward because you have already come this far.
You enter the next room, and are greeted by this inscription carved into the floor. The ceiling is too dark for even your flashlight to illuminate. You hear a ticking noise.
You ponder what could possibly await you this time, and begin looking around the room. It does not seem special, but it is definitely darker than the last room, the darkness almost seeming to eat the beam from your flashlight. You explore some and find that there are three doors and a statue. The doors have a certain texture on them, hard to see but definitely able to be felt. There is a square area marked on the floor in front of the doors. You notice it would be too difficult to move quickly from one to the other.
The statue is of a woman, and even though her eyes are closed, she appears to have a kind look on her face. One of her arms is missing below the elbow, but it appeared to be in a resting position near her torso when attached. The other arm is outstretched, her palm facing upward.
The door you walked through was noticeably smooth, the floor you are on is bumpy, and the walls around you are rough. The ticking is accelerating.
You dust yourself off, and look through the door, apprehensive about what you will encounter next.
The room is very captivating to the eye; ornaments strewn about the place, different patterns covering all surfaces in a way that would be tacky anywhere else but seems oddly at home here. You do not focus on anything for too long, as it is quite distracting and grating to the eye. The light in the room seems to be reflected from the outside through a series of small mirrors, and feels very suffocated and unnatural by the time it reaches the room.
On one of the shelves, you find a scroll. It is camouflaged by the paisley pattern that covers the shelf and part of the wall. As soon as you move it, your eyes are able to pick it up and you are able to focus clearly on it. You take out your little book again, and decipher the following:
You store the scroll in your backpack, and keep looking around the room. You are primarily worried about any traps in the room, but it feels quite still and peaceful. You look closely at the trinkets, and they seem to be oriented in two different directions. The first is facing the door you just entered. The rest seem to be facing one of the other walls. Since you are still near the door from the last room, you decide to look more closely.
The patterns on the wall are very ornate, and seem to originate from a single point on the wall before spreading out toward the rest of the room. You touch the wall, but it does not feel flat like you expect it to be. From feeling around, you realize it actually curves  inward, almost as if it was collapsing in on the point on the wall from which the patterns emerge.
An intrusive thought makes its way into your head, almost as if someone was telling you something from within your own head.
You take a step back, creeped out, but decide it is probably nothing. You look around the room quickly, making sure you are alone. Everything is still where it was, and you slowly relax, assuming it was probably something automatic like the traps or the vine from before.
You decide that if this wall was special, the other trinkets must be pointing at the other special wall too. You take a look at some bronze money figurines on a table. They are facing the other wall, the three of them side by side on the top of a piece of nicely varnished wood. The first is covering its eyes, the second has its hand over its mouth, and the final has its hands clasped in front of it. You remember a saying that goes something along the lines of "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil". What do you do?
Suddenly, you hear your own voice from the other side, and it tells you
You stagger backward, definitely uncomfortable with what just happened. You press your palm to your ear and rub it gently, trying to forget the feeling of what just happened. You look back at the wall, and notice there is now a door there, with a small hole in the center around where you had your ear.
You are very hesitant to keep going, but realize that there is probably no way to go back at this point. Your only hope of getting out is going through the rooms and hoping there is an exit down the line. You jot down the two pieces of information you got from that room, and take a few minutes to collect yourself. This is by far your weirdest adventure as a treasure hunter, but you hope it will be worth it down the line. Before you go through, you notice there is something carved into the door, but it looks worn and has little contrast, so you can quite make it out. You take a piece of paper and press it up to the door, then with a pencil you color the paper until you transfer over the carvings from the wall. The area where the carvings where does not have as much graphite as the rest, and you can make out the symbols. It says:
You put this paper back in your notebook, and push open the door. The other room looks like a fancy restaurant to you. It has a stage for performers, and tables set up with everything one would need to enjoy a meal. There is no one else around, no food anywhere to be seen. The bar is empty, and the stage has instruments but no band.
You notice that the silence of the room is slowly fading, being replaced by some noise. You look around, but nothing is happening in your surroundings, everything is just as you left it. Slowly, the noise reaches its normal volume, and it sounds exactly how you would imagine the restaurant sounding. There is some soft jazz coming from the stage, the clattering of the dishes and utensils, murmuring from the tables, sizzling and clanging from beyond the walls that resembles the noises of a kitchen. You are extremely unnerved when you notice a menu is now in front of you, the cover made of fake leather with fake gold plated corners. You open it to find a sheet of paper behind the plastic covers, that says in perfect English
You stand up quickly, and the noise dies down as if the patrons and everyone else had suddenly stopped to look at who made the commotion. You grab your things and look quickly at the walls around you for a way out. You see a double glass door that leads to what looks like a city street outside and bolt toward it.
You open the doors to find yourself in a stairwell. It is very nondescript, nothing seems special about it, at all. You take some time to lean against the wall and catch your breath while your heartbeat is in your ears and throat, ready to jump out at the next sign of trouble.
You feel a small, dull pain in your stomach as if someone had just hit you, but it is not too concerning. The notebook is mostly empty.There is only your name on the inside of the front cover, and some text on the first page. It reads:
You sigh. Yet again, more weird and cryptic hints. But at least you seem to be making progress. You get up and face the stairs. The only way to go is down. You steady yourself and begin walking down the stairs into the unknown.
After a few flights, you reach a utility closet. It has a sign that reads “staff only”, but the door is unlocked and partially open. You call out, and when you hear no response, you enter. It is a well lit room, with a desk, a computer, a chair, and some other things you might expect in a small office/ utility closet. You sit down in the chair, and look at the screen, which has text flying by. You are too tired to care, and decide now is as good a time as any to rest. You take out some of your provisions and have a small meal. After finishing, you decide to barricade the room and sleep for a few hours.
What do you do when you wake up?
The new writing reads:
You turn to the computer, which is now displaying a desktop screen, with a few files. Their names match the names in your notes. You click on the files, messing around with them. The icons match a few items in the room. The thalamus icon is the router on the desk next to the computer.The hippocampus icon is the filing cabinet next to you. The amygdala catches your eye. It looks like the crystal ball on the desk. It looks like one of the mood teller trinkets that change color when you touch it. You read the inscription on the bottom, and match the color of the ball to the list of emotions: relaxed. You go to set it down, but you are caught off guard by the weight, and it falls to the floor and shatters loudly. The liquid inside turns red, and after a few seconds of being frozen in place, you quickly pick up the base to read what mood that is. Your hands shake as you read the single word: fear. You scramble to get out of the room.
Swinging the door wide open, you notice the stairwell now has graffiti on the walls over the hastily painted walls. It reads:
You are quite shaken by the sudden turn of events, but the sudden sound of footsteps above you suddenly bring you to focus all at once.
You hear some exclamations coming from the flight above you. You cannot quite understand what is going on, and you decide it is probably best not to find out.
You reach a landing that is pretty wide. Cheap white linoleum tiles and dull white paint remind you of a generic, boring waiting room. There is little color in the form of a green stripe near the bottom of the wall, and a few fake plants and plastic chairs. A set of metal detectors stand between you and the other end of the room, where you see the a sign for another stairwell.
You take your backpack and jacket off, flinging them to the other side. You turn sideways and begin shimming through to the other side. After an agonizing minute, you have made it through. The footsteps in the stairwell sound closer as you snatch your belongings and swing open the stairwell door.
The door opens, but a puff of some sort of smoke hits your face. You try to hold your breath but it is too late. The smoke tastes somewhat sweet like berries, there is some ringing in your ears and you stumble toward the stairs. Grasping the railing, you stumble down a flight of stairs before hearing the metal detector go off on the floor above you.
You arrive at the end of the stairs after a few more flights, which lead to a hallway that looks similar to the room with the metal detectors. You see a big, heavy door at the end, and the two elevator doors next to the end of the stairs. You stumble toward the heavy door. But as you pass the elevators, you hear a slow but steady noise coming from them.
When you touch the door, it lights up, and one of the buttons blinks, making an accompanying beep. After some hesitation, you tap the same button. The keypad lights up the same button, followed by two more. You repeat the pattern. As you do so, you hear the elevator make a bell noise as it reaches the bottom. You turn instinctively as your heart races to see the light at the other end of the hallway has turned off.
You frantically press the last button, and the door begins to swing open. You hear footsteps at the end of the hall as two more lights turn off. The door is moving slowly, and you cannot make it open any faster, nor can you squeeze through. The effects of the smoke begin to take their toll, and you begin to feel sleepy, and your panic is dulled somewhat.
You begin to sway in place as the door opens and the footsteps become louder and more numerous. The door is now open enough to see only darkness on the other side. You cannot see or feel any floor. You turn around to see there are only two lights still lit in the hallway. You face the void again, contemplating your next move.
Your mind feels foggy. You fall for about a minute before anything happens. Suddenly, you feel like you have stopped moving. You do not hear the air rushing by your ears, nor the gut feeling of falling. You realize your eyes are closed. You open them to find yourself in the jungle, under the shade of one of the trees. The huge stone with the mechanism you used to turn the boulders is still there, but the carving is gone.
You feel unsteady, much too shaky to stand. You check your watch for the first time since leaving the village earlier. It is only been about 10 minutes since you arrived in the area. Confused, you rummage through your backpack. The crystal you found at the beginning and the other things you had taken from the interior were replaced with rocks, plants, and branches of equivalent size. You are dumbfounded, until you grasp the scroll with the paisley pattern. It is very real, and the text inside it and your notebook is the same. You cannot find the second notebook from the stairwell, but the things written in it are in your old notebook, as well as some additions you do not remember making. You sit, looking at the sky and listening to the birds around you. You found a different treasure than the one you were seeking, but you leave content.
Thanks for playing!
